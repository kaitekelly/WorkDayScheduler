# WorkDayScheduler# WorkDayScheduler
A simple work day scheduler calendar application for keeping track of hourly appts and todo's.

When I put a task into the input field and click save, the calendar commits the task to my computer's local storage. 
As the day progresses, the input field will update with a color code by past, present, and future. 
Hours in the past will show up in grey, the current hour will show up red, and the past hour will be shaded green.
